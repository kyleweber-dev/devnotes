# Developer Journey Log

## Introduction

## Coding Session Logs

This section contains my check-ins whenever I update this repository. These logs will help me and others track my progress as I continue to learn and improve.

### ✔ 14 Feb 2025

- Launched my [Portfolio](https://kyleweber.dev)
- Built and deployed a [Google Landing Page](https://google-homepage.kyleweber.dev/)

**Check-In Notes:**

> Today, I’m feeling more confident with HTML and CSS. Flexbox, Grid, and other core layout concepts are finally starting to click. Moving forward, I’ll reinforce my full-stack development skills by incorporating design into my workflow. I plan to start using Figma to create simple layouts and then bring them to life with code.

### ✔ 6 Feb 2025

- Created git repository
- Created `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, `Markdown`, and `React` notes
- Completed `Markdown` notes

**Check-In Notes:**

> As of today, I am proficient in creating a simple static website in `HTML`. I can apply some `CSS` to it, but not in the most efficient way. My goals moving forward are to keep using [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to assist in learning.
