# Developer Journey Log

## Introduction

> This is where I'll document my learning journey as I work toward becoming a skilled developer. This log will track my progress, reflect on my learning experiences, and serve as a resource for others who may be on a similar path.

## Resources

Below are links to tools and resources I frequently use during my journey:

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/)

## Goals & Progress

Here is where I will track my current progress with the different coding languages I want to learn. Once I feel I've achieved a solid understanding, I'll mark it as complete.

- [x] Markdown
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS

## Coding Session Logs

This section contains my check-ins whenever I update this repository. These logs will help me and others track my progress as I continue to learn and improve.

#### **2025-02-06**

- Created git repository
- Created `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, `Markdown`, and `React` notes
- Completed `Markdown` notes

**Check-In Notes:**

> As of today, I am proficient in creating a simple static website in `HTML`. I can apply some `CSS` to it, but not in the most efficient way. My goals moving forward are to keep using [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to assist in learning.
